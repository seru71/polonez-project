I will try to put updates on my Polonez fellowship here, together with some materials, links and other useful information.
Major updates on [Remus](https://github.com/seru71/Remus) development should also find its way on the timeline down here.

Some basic information about the project's scope and aims can be found on hosting department [pages](https://biostat.umed.pl/polonez.php).
